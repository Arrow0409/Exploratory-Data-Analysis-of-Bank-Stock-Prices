# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Bank-Stock-Prices

Objective:
Perform EDA on bank stock prices, specifically focusing on the period spanning the financial crisis of 2007â€“2008 to early 2016. This project aims to enhance visualization and Pandas skills without providing financial advice.

Key Steps:
Data Loading:

Load historical stock price data for selected bank stocks (e.g., Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase) from reliable financial sources.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing or inconsistent data.
Convert date columns to datetime objects.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Explore general trends in bank stock prices over the specified period.
Identify key events during the financial crisis and examine their impact on stock prices.
Visualization:

Plot stock price trends for selected banks using line charts.
Use additional visualizations (e.g., candlestick charts) for deeper insights.
Statistical Analysis:

Calculate and analyze descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) of stock prices.
Investigate correlations between bank stocks.
Volatility Analysis:

Assess stock price volatility during the financial crisis.
Consider rolling standard deviations or other relevant measures.
Dividend and Stock Splits:

Check for any significant dividend payouts or stock splits during the analyzed period.
Adjust stock prices accordingly for a more accurate analysis.
Results:
The EDA will provide insights into how bank stocks performed during the financial crisis and subsequent years. Visualizations and statistical analyses will help identify trends, patterns, and potential correlations.
